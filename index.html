                HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT FROM ECMA SCRIPT 1 TO ES6

                HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT
            </h4>
            <p>
                JavaScript is most widely used now a days and most preferable language for development as front-end as well back-end,<br>
                ECMAScript is an simple standard for JavaScript and adding new features to JavaScript,ECMAScript is a subset of JavaScript.  <br>
                JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds upon it. <br> <br> <br><br>
                The history is, Brendan Eich created Mocha which became <br>
                LiveScript, and later JavaScript. Netscape presented JavaScript to Ecma International, which develops <br>
                standards and it was renamed to ECMA-262 aka ECMAScript.
                It's important to note that Brendan Eich's <br>
                “JavaScript” is not the same JavaScript that is a dialect of ECMAScript.
                He built the core language which <br>
                was renamed to ECMAScript, which differs from the JavaScript which browser-vendors implement nowadays. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape Communications and part of the ex-Mosaic team, had the vision <br>
                that the web needed a way to become more dynamic. Animations, interaction and other forms of small <br>
                automation should be part of the web of the future. So the web needed a small scripting language that <br>
                could interact with the DOM (which was not set in stone as it is right now). But, and this was an  <br>
                important strategic call at the time, this scripting language should not be oriented to big-shot  <br>
                developers and people with experience in the software engineering side of things. Java was on the rise <br>
                as well, and Java applets were to be a reality soon. So the scripting language for the web would need to <br>
                cater to a different type of audience: designers. Indeed, the web was static. HTML was still young and simple <br>
                enough for non-developers to pick up. So whatever was to be part of the browser to make the web more <br>
                dynamic should be accessible to non-programmers. And so the idea of Mocha was born. Mocha was to become a <br>
                scripting language for the web. Simple, dynamic, and accessible to non-developers, there`s an need to <br>
                more Words about javaScript history but you can read further in blogs.

                ECMAScript as Standard
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ECMA-262: The Ecma International (a standards organization) has created the ECMA-262 standard which <br>
                     is the official specification of the ECMAScript language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ecma's Technical Committee 39 (TC39): is the group of people (Brendan Eich and others) who develop the <br>
                     ECMA-262 standard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ECMAScript 3 (December 1999). This is the version of ECMAScript that most browsers support today. <br>
                    It introduced many features that have become an inherent part of the language:regular <br>
                    expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter <br>
                    definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and other enhancements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ECMAScript 4 (abandoned July 2008). ECMAScript 4 was developed as the next version of JavaScript, with <br>
                    a prototype written in ML. However, TC39 could not agree on its feature set. To prevent an impasse, the <br>
                    committee met at the end of July 2008 and came to an accord, summarized in four points
                     <ol>
                        <li>
                            Develop an incremental update of ECMAScript [which became ECMAScript 5.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Develop a major new release, which was to be more modest than ECMAScript 4, but much larger in scope than the version after <br>
                            ECMAScript 3. This version has been code-named Harmony, due to the nature of the meeting in which it was conceived.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Features from ECMAScript 4 that would be dropped: packages, namespaces, early binding.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Other ideas were to be developed in consensus with all of TC39
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            Thus: The ECMAScript 4 developers agreed to make Harmony less radical than <br>
                            ECMAScript 4, the rest of TC39 agreed to keep moving things forward.
                        </p>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    ECMAScript 5 (December 2009): This version brings several enhancements to the <br>
                    standard library and even updated language semantics via a strict mode.

                <li>
                    ECMAScript 6(2015) :ES6 is an next-gen of JavaScript, the ecma technical committee 39  <br>
                    governs ecma specification, they discovered new features to the javascript. <br> <br>
                    ES6 can`t compile directly in browsers, so need an compiler from ES6 to ES5, <br>
                    for that compiling using babel, it produce the browser compatible javascript. <br><br>
                    ES6 includes the following new features: <br><br>
